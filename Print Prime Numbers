Write a query to print all prime numbers less than or equal to . Print your result on a single line, and use the ampersand () character as your separator (instead of a space).

For example, the output for all prime numbers would be:

2&3&5&7



SET SERVEROUTPUT ON;
DECLARE
COUNTER NUMBER;
K NUMBER;
RESULT CLOB;
BEGIN
RESULT := ‘’;
FOR N IN 2..1000 LOOP
COUNTER := 0;
K := FLOOR(N/2);
FOR i IN 2..K LOOP
IF(MOD(N,i)=0) THEN
COUNTER :=1;
END IF;
END LOOP;
IF (COUNTER = 0) THEN
RESULT := RESULT||N||’&’;
END IF;
END LOOP;
DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(SUBSTR(RESULT,0,length(RESULT)-1));
END;
/
